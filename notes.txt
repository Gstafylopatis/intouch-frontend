-For clientForm:
    --Router in App.js imports functional Component clientFormWrapper
    --We need to go with functional Component to use hook useParams
    --and get the client id.
    --Then we return <clientForm params={params}/>
    --clientForm extends form class that houses the necessary functions
    --to render the form, as well as the state. clientForm's job is to
    --get the data from the clientService, populate the state and then submit
    --the data to the service after submission
